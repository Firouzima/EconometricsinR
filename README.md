# Econometrics in R
I have conducted a series of short R lectures for course the Advanced Econometrics I under the supervision of Dr. Alireza Oryoie. These lectures are largely based on the following sources:
* Introduction to Econometrics with R by Christoph Hanck, Martin Arnold, Alexander Gerber, and Martin Schmelzer
*  R for Data Science (Second Edition) by Hadley Wickham, Mine Çetinkaya-Rundel and Garrett Grolemund
*  Applied Econometrics with R by Christian Kleiber and Achim Zeileis
*   Using R for Introductory Econometrics (Second Edition) by Florian Heiss
